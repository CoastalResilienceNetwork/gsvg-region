      <abstract>A digital elevation model (DEM) representing seafloor topography was derived from the visible bands of the WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite imagery using field data and a statistical model. Geolocated water depth estimates were gathered using an acoustic depth sounder attached to a small research vessel. These data points were paired with WV2 image pixels using a nearest neighbour kernal. The statistical model was an expansion of the band ratio of Stumpf et al (2003) from linear regression to multiple linear regression (MLR). The MLR model contained six band ratios. The model’s coefficients were estimated by comparing the water depth soundings with the paired band ratio values. The estimated coefficients were used to predict water depth for all pixels within the satellite image. The data are an underwater DEM of the seafloor for the study region. Depth values are in meters. Maximum estimated depth is 25 m. Seabed topography allows a fully three-dimensional reconstruction of the depositional environment. Seabed morphology can be used to reconstruct processes sculpting the system across geological and ecological time-scales.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were created under the direction of The Nature Conservancy for the Ecosystem Based Adaptation in the Grenadine Bank project (AWE). This project is built on the hypothesis that the neighboring and ecologically connected small island states in the Grenadine Bank can enhance the resilience of people and nature to climate change impacts by protecting, restoring and sustainably managing marine and coastal systems and strengthening community capacity for adaptation.</purpose>
