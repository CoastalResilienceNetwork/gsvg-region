      <abstract>Landing sites in Grenada. At time of completion, the attribute table was incomplete pending more research by TNC and the Fisheries Division. "No Data" values are represented as "-9999" in the attribute table. Landing Site names with a "*" next to it indicates data collected from the Fisheries Department from a low resolution map. Exact locations for these areas may not be accurate and may need updating as the project progresses. Ronde Island is located outside of the enumeration districts of Grenada and therefore has no parish or ED number associated with it.Production (landing) data is from 2010. This data was collected for the primary landing sites only. Data for Carriacou was collected. This data was applied to the Hillsborough landing site as it is the only primary landing site in Carriacou. Vessel data was taken from a Vessel Registration document collected from the Fisheries Division. This document is added to every year with new and re-registered boats. It is unknown how many of the counted boats are no longer in service or how many have been counted multiple times due to re-registering. The file age is unknown, but is believed to go back to at least 1987.</abstract>
      <purpose>Developed to locate and visualize fish landing sites in Grenada. This information will help inform the Nature Conservancy's AWE project about the impact of inundation on economically important places like fish landing sites.Scientists around the world agree that climate change is indisputable.  Impacts, including rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, warming temperatures and acidifying waters, dying coral reefs, shifting fish stocks, and incidence of flooding and drought, are already being felt, and are expected to continue and increase for decades to come.Nature holds some of the world’s best and most practical solutions to climate change, solutions that keep nature and people healthy, safe, and secure. The goal of At the Water’s Edge (AWE) is to demonstrate that governments and people in vulnerable coastal communities in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) can enhance their resilience to climate change by protecting, restoring and effectively managing their marine and coastal ecosystems (also known as ecosystem-based adaptation or EBA) and strengthening local capacity for adaptation.</purpose>
