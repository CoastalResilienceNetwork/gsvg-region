      <abstract>The landfills file was created for the AWE Project being run by the Nature Conservancy. Three (3) landfill datasets were used in creating just this one file. 1.) The Grenada dump file which was clipped (collected for the gap assessment). 2.) The SVG dump file (collected for the gap assessment). 3.) Kim Baldwin's work through the MarSIS project.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data layers were compiled from original data files created for a protected area gap assessment for the countries of Grenada and St. Vincent and Grenadines and for the MarSIS project. The gap project identified critical conservation targets and threats for these countries working with existing data layers from local governments filling data gaps through data creation through digitizing off high-resolution imagery. The objectives were to a) Develop a GIS-based geographic extent of the study area based, but not limited to, bathymetry, and other physiographic factors; b) Compile all existing GIS data layers for all terrestrial, freshwater, and marine biological conservation targets and socioeconomic threats; c) Analyze existent GIS data layers, identify gaps and fill them by creating data from primary image sources; d) Produce a final geodatabase and associated metadata. The Grenadines Marine Resource Space-use Information System (MarSIS) brings together a variety of social, economic and environmental information drawn from both scientific and local knowledge into a single information system. Therefore areas important for livelihoods and conservation can be better identified and this unique information used to assist management and planning sustainable development across the Grenadine island chain. </purpose>
