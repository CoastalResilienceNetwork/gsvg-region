      <abstract>Layer identifies enumeration districts for the 2011 census. ED boundaries were manually shifted to line up along road and river boundaries where they appeared shifted to make the file orthorectified. A description of each field can be found in the Field and Subtypes part of the metadata.</abstract>
      <purpose>Developed for the 2011 census. Resource developed to help summarize all the raw census information that was used to calculate the socioeconomic indices. This information will help inform the Nature Conservancy's AWE project. 
Scientists around the world agree that climate change is indisputable. Impacts, including rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, warming temperatures and acidifying waters, dying coral reefs, shifting fish stocks, and incidence of flooding and drought, are already being felt, and are expected to continue and increase for decades to come. 
Nature holds some of the world’s best and most practical solutions to climate change, solutions that keep nature and people healthy, safe, and secure. The goal of At the Water’s Edge (AWE) is to demonstrate that governments and people in vulnerable coastal communities in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) can enhance their resilience to climate change by protecting, restoring and effectively managing their marine and coastal ecosystems (also known as ecosystem-based adaptation or EBA) and strengthening local capacity for adaptation.
