      <abstract>These layers were created from the P3DM model that was created in Union Island, St. Vincent and the Grenadines in March 2013. This layer represents sea moss farming locations that were marked on the model by community members. As no scale was used during the process, many of the actual locations had to be guessed based on the areas placed on the model and actual imagery. The location of these areas has not been groundtruthed and in cases where no obvious water was seen on imagery, was simply guessed at.</abstract>
      <purpose>This information will help inform the Nature Conservancy's AWE project. Scientists around the world agree that climate change is indisputable. Impacts, including rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, warming temperatures and acidifying waters, dying coral reefs, shifting fish stocks, and incidence of flooding and drought, are already being felt, and are expected to continue and increase for decades to come. Nature holds some of the world’s best and most practical solutions to climate change, solutions that keep nature and people healthy, safe, and secure. The goal of At the Water’s Edge (AWE) is to demonstrate that governments and people in vulnerable coastal communities in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) can enhance their resilience to climate change by protecting, restoring and effectively managing their marine and coastal ecosystems (also known as ecosystem-based adaptation or EBA) and strengthening local capacity for adaptation.</purpose>
