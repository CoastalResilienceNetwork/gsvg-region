      <abstract>The coral reef file was created for the AWE Project being run by the Nature Conservancy. Six (6) coral reef datasets were used in creating just this one file. 1.) The Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project (MCRMP) through IMaRS at USF with Dr. Serge Andrefouet being the principle investigator who developed a reef classification applied that to derived reef morphology from 30m Landsat data. 2.) A project dataset shared by the Planning Department of St. Vincent and the Grenadines which was developed for the SVG CRIS and data was digitized from LANDSAT 1999 by Alan Mills and others. 3.) Kim Baldwin's work through the MarSIS resulted in a benthic habitat file which she created by heads up digitizing effort using IKONOS imagery. This was cleaned up by John Knowles. 4). Brigham Young University students, under contract by the Nature Conservancy, digitized polygons for the country of Grenada using WorldView2 2010 orthophotos. 5.) The Grenville area of Grenada and Union Island of St. Vincent and the Grenadines was created through object-oriented mapping using Definiens eCognition software on 2010 WorldView2 imagery by NCRI. 6.) Southern Grenada and all of SVG except Union Island was created through object-oriented mapping on 2010 WorldView2 imagery through two separate contracts with Sam Purkins.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were created under the direction of The Nature Conservancy for the Ecosystem Based Adaptation in the Grenadine Bank project (AWE). This project is built on the hypothesis that the neighboring and ecologically connected small island states in the Grenadine Bank can enhance the resilience of people and nature to climate change impacts by protecting, restoring and sustainably managing marine and coastal systems and strengthening community capacity for adaptation.</purpose>
