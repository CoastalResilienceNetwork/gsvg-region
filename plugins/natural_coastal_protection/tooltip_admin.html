    <h3>Flood Extent</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Area potentially inundated with 3m sea level rise. Dataset created by The Nature Conservancy for the Ecosystem Based Adaptation in the Grenadine Bank project (AWE).</p>

    <h3>Population</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Count and percentage of population within the flood extent. Estimated using WorldPop 2016 Latin America and the Caribbean 1km Population 
        which estimates total number of people per grid square for five timepoints between 2000 and 2020 at five year intervals <a href='https://www.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=141' target='_blank'><b>Source</b><a></br> 
        **Disclaimer - The flood extent layer is much finer resolution than this population file, so number of people in the flood zone is a very rough estimate.</p>
    
    <h3>Poverty</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Percentage of total population in poverty within admin unit. Indicators include: Human and Civic Resources 
        (available workforce, access to social networks, highest level of education), Healthy Population (share of population with health insurance,
         number of disabilities per 100 people, infant mortality), and Economic Resources (share of population with property insurance and alternative
          supplemental livelihood). Data from 2001 and 2011 assessment were combined to create an Adaptive Capacity Sub-Index. </p>

    <h3>Vulnerable Population</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Percentage of total population under 5 or over 65 years of age</p>

    <h3>Roads</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Length of roads within the flood extent. Data digitized from WorldView 2010 and 2007 aerial photos. Data provided by the Physical Planning Department.</p>

    <h3>Critical Facilities</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Number of critical facilities in flood extent. Transportation terminal data from Grenada Port Authority. Water treatment plant data from National Water and Sewage Authority GIS Department. Cell tower location data from National Telecom Regulatory Commission. Electric plants data from Grenada Electricity Services Ltd.</p>

    <h3>Emergency Facilities</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Number of emergency infrastructure in flood extent . Police Stations; Fire Stations; Emergency Shelters (churches, schools, other); Medical Facilities created by Jerry Mitchell for The Nature Conservancy's At the Water’s Edge Project (2012). The list of emergency shelters was obtained from NaDMA.</p>

    <h3>Community Facilities </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Number of community facilities in flood extent. School data from the Windward Islands Research and Educational Foundation. Hotel data from Grenada Board of Tourism. Cruise Ports from protected area gap assessment for the countries of Grenada and St. Vincent and Grenadines.</p>

    <h3>Housing Density</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Housing units density (per sq mile). Data collected from the Grenada Census Department from the 2011 census.</p>

    <h3>Climate Vulnerability</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Percentage of households vulnerable to coastal hazards. Index combines 2001 and 2011 data across three variables.
        <ol>
            <li>Social Sensitivity: Access to Critical Infrastructure and Facilities (transportation terminals, critical facilities, emergency response , roads), Dependent Demographic Groups (very old or young, without access to emergency information), and Livelihood Dependence on Marine Goods and Services (fisheries, tourism for jobs).</li>
            <li>Adaptive Capacity: Human and Civic Resources (available workforce, access to social networks, highest level of education), Healthy Population (share of population with health insurance, number of disabilities per 100 people, infant mortality), and Economic Resources (share of population with property insurance and alternative supplemental livelihood).</li>
            <li>Exposure: percent flooded area per enumeration district.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Reef Area</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Total area (sq km) of coral reef within a 5km buffer and 1km of coastal area. As part of the Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem project in 2013, data digitized, validated against high resolution imagery, and combined with other data including ""Tropical Coral Reefs of the World (2011)"" from the World's Resources Institute. </p>

    <h3>Mangrove Area</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Total area (sq km) of mangrove within a 5km buffer and 1km of coastal area. As part of the Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem project in 2013, data digitized, validated against high resolution, imagery, and combined with other data including  "World Atlas of Mangroves (2012)" from Mark Spalding.</p>

    <h3>Seagrass Area</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Total area (sq km) of seagrass within a 5km buffer and 1km of coastal area. As part of the Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem project in 2013, data digitized, validated against high resolution imagery, and combined with other data including the "World Atlas of Seagrasses (2003)" from the UN Environment Programme – World Conservation Monitoring Centre.</p>

    <h3>Mangrove Change</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Positive or negative change in mangrove coverage between 2013 - 2018. From normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis on Landsat 8 satellite data between 2013-2018.</p>
